    <P style="font-style: oblique;">A planet symbol (or planetary symbol) is a graphical symbol used in astrology and astronomy to represent a classical planet (including the Sun and the Moon) or one of the modern planets. The symbols were also used in alchemy to represent the metals associated with the planets, and in calendars for their associated days. The use of these symbols derives from Classical Greco-Roman astronomy, though their current shapes are a development of the 16th century.</P>

        <center><img src="sun.jpg" width="200" height="150" clip-path="circle"/></center>
        <p style="font-style: oblique;">Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
        It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. 
        The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
        The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.
        Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20]
        Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[21]
        </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: blue">MERCURY</span></h2>
            <img src="mercury.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float: left;"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
            Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
            It is named after the Roman god Mercurius(Mercury),god of commerce,messenger of the gods,and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes(Ἑρμῆς).
            Like Venus,Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet;its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
            This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
            At this time,it may appear as a bright star-like object,but is more difficult to observe than Venus.
            From Earth,the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases,similar to Venus and the Moon,which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.
            Due to its synodic proximity to Earth,Mercury is most often the closest planet to Earth,with Venus periodically taking this role.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align:right"><span style="color: blue">VENUS</span></h2>
            <img src="venus.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float: right;"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Venus is the second planet from the Sun.
             It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. 
             As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star.
            Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth in dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: blue">EARTH</span></h2>
            <img src="earth.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float:left;"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability.
             While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the Earth with its ocean, making Earth an ocean world.
            Earth's polar regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water. 
            Land, consisting of continents and islands, extends over 29.2% of the Earth and is widely covered by vegetation.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: blue">MARS</span></h2>
            <img src="mars.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float:right;"/>
            <p style="font-style:oblique;">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only than Mercury.
            In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. 
            Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. 
            Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. 
            Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. </p>
            <h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color: blue">JUPITER</span></h2>
            <img src="jupiter.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float:left;"/>
            <p style="font-style:oblique;">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
            It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
            Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. 
            It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: blue;">SATURN</span></h2>
            <img src="saturn.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float:right"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
            It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
            It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: blue;">URANUS</span></h2>
            <img src="uranus.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float: left;"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. 
            It is named after Greek sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek mythology is the father of Cronus (Saturn), a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather of Ares (Mars). 
            Uranus has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
            The planet is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from those of the other two giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants).
             For this reason, scientists often distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: blue;">NEPTUNE</span></h2>
            <img src="Neptune.jpg" width="200" height="100" style="float: right;"/>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System.
            It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
            It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
            Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
            Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. 
            The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles).
            It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.</p>
